# Wheel of Fortune

This project will take you through the process of implementing a simplified version of the game Wheel of Fortune. 

*Here are the rules of our game:*

* There are num_human human players and num_computer computer players.
* Every player has some amount of money ($0 at the start of the game)
* Every player has a set of prizes (none at the start of the game)
* The goal is to guess a phrase within a category. For example:
```Category: Artist & Song
Phrase: Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You
Category: Artist & Song
Phrase: _______ _______'_ _ ____ ______ ____ ___
```
Players see the category and an obscured version of the phrase where every alphanumeric character in the phrase starts out as hidden (using underscores: _)

Note that case (capitalization) does not matter

During their turn, every player spins the wheel to determine a prize amount and:

* If the wheel lands on a cash square, players may do one of three actions:
    * Guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed by typing a letter (a-z)
    * Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) cost $250 to guess and can’t be guessed if the player doesn’t have enough money. All other letters are “free” to guess
* The player can guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed and gets that cash amount for every time that letter appears in the phrase
* If there is a prize, the user also gets that prize (in addition to any prizes they already had)
* If the letter does appear in the phrase, the user keeps their turn. Otherwise, it’s the next player’s turn

*Example*: The user lands on $500 and guesses ‘W’. There are three W’s in the phrase, so the player wins $1500

* Guess the complete phrase by typing a phrase (anything over one character that isn’t ‘pass’)
    * If they are correct, they win the game
    * If they are incorrect, it is the next player’s turn. Pass their turn by entering 'pass'
    * If the wheel lands on “lose a turn”, the player loses their turn and the game moves on to the next player
    * If the wheel lands on “bankrupt”, the player loses their turn and loses their money but they keep all of the prizes they have won so far.

The game continues until the entire phrase is revealed (or one player guesses the complete phrase)


### Part A: WOFPlayer

We’re going to start by defining a class to represent a Wheel of Fortune player, called WOFPlayer. Every instance of WOFPlayer has three instance variables:

* .name: The name of the player (should be passed into the constructor)
* .prizeMoney: The amount of prize money for this player (an integer, initialized to 0)
* .prizes: The prizes this player has won so far (a list, initialized to [])

Of these instance variables, only name should be passed into the constructor.

It should also have the following methods (note: we will exclude self in our descriptions):

* .addMoney(amt): Add amt to self.prizeMoney
* .goBankrupt(): Set self.prizeMoney to 0
* .addPrize(prize): Append prize to self.prizes
* .\__str__(): Returns the player’s name and prize money in the following format:
Steve ($1800) (for a player with instance variables .name == 'Steve' and prizeMoney == 1800)

### Part B: WOFHumanPlayer

Next, we’re going to define a class named WOFHumanPlayer, which should inherit from WOFPlayer (part A). This class is going to represent a human player. In addition to having all of the instance variables and methods that WOFPlayer has, WOFHumanPlayer should have an additional method:

* .getMove(category, obscuredPhrase, guessed): Should ask the user to enter a move (using input()) and return whatever string they entered.
* .getMove()’s prompt should be:
```text
{name} has ${prizeMoney}

Category: {category}
Phrase:  {obscured_phrase}
Guessed: {guessed}

Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':
For example:

Steve has $200

Category: Places
Phrase: _L___ER N____N_L P_RK
Guessed: B, E, K, L, N, P, R, X, Z

Guess a letter, phrase, or type 'exit' or 'pass':
```

The user can then enter:
 - 'exit' to exit the game
 - 'pass' to skip their turn
 - a single character to guess that letter
 - a complete phrase (a multi-character phrase other than 'exit' or 'pass') to guess that phrase

Note that *.getMove()* does not need to enforce anything about the user’s input; that will be done via the game logic that we define in the next ActiveCode window.

### Part C: WOFComputerPlayer

Finally, we’re going to define a class named WOFComputerPlayer, which should inherit from WOFPlayer (part A). This class is going to represent a computer player.

Every computer player will have a difficulty instance variable. Players with a higher difficulty generally play “better”. There are many ways to implement this. We’ll do the following:

 - If there aren’t any possible letters to choose (for example: if the last character is a vowel but this player doesn’t have enough to guess a vowel), we’ll 'pass'
 - Otherwise, semi-randomly decide whether to make a “good” move or a “bad” move on a given turn (a higher difficulty should make it more likely for the player to make a “good” move)
 - To make a “bad” move, we’ll randomly decide on a possible letter.
 - To make a “good” move, we’ll choose a letter according to their overall frequency in the English language.


In addition to having all of the instance variables and methods that WOFPlayer has, WOFComputerPlayer should have:

##### Class variable

* .SORTED_FREQUENCIES: Should be set to 'ZQXJKVBPYGFWMUCLDRHSNIOATE', which is a list of English characters sorted from least frequent ('Z') to most frequent ('E'). We’ll use this when trying to make a “good” move.
Additional Instance variable
* .difficulty: The level of difficulty for this computer (should be passed as the second argument into the constructor after .name)

##### Methods

 - .smartCoinFlip(): This method will help us decide semi-randomly whether to make a “good” or “bad” move. A higher difficulty should make us more likely to make a “good” move. Implement this by choosing a random number between 1 and 10 using random.randint(1, 10) (see above) and returning True if that random number is greater than self.difficulty. If the random number is less than or equal to self.difficulty, return False.
 - .getPossibleLetters(guessed): This method should return a list of letters that can be guessed.

These should be characters that are in LETTERS ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') but not in the guessed parameter.

Additionally, if this player doesn’t have enough prize money to guess a vowel (variable VOWEL_COST set to 250), then vowels (variable VOWELS set to 'AEIOU') should not be included
.getMove(category, obscuredPhrase, guessed): Should return a valid move.
Use the .getPossibleLetters(guessed) method described above.
 - If there aren’t any letters that can be guessed (this can happen if the only letters left to guess are vowels and the player doesn’t have enough for vowels), return 'pass'
 - Use the .smartCoinFlip() method to decide whether to make a “good” or a “bad” move
 - If making a “good” move (.smartCoinFlip() returns True), then return the most frequent (highest index in .SORTED_FREQUENCIES) possible character
 - If making a “bad” move (.smartCoinFlip() returns False), then return a random character from the set of possible characters (use random.choice())
