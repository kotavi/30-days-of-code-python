# The Python Imaging Library (PIL)

The Python Imaging Library, which is known as PIL or PILLOW, is the main library we use in python for dealing with image files. This library is not included with python - it's what's known as a third party library, which means you have to download and install it yourself. In the Coursera system, this has all been done for you. Lets do a little exploring of pillow in the jupyter notebooks.
